# Data Wrangling:
  Removed the Ticket column since it is unnecessary for the data analysis.
  
# Data Exploration:
 Investigated the data using different types of methods and questions.
 
#Conclusion:
Based on the data deduced from analyzing the Titanic data we can conclude that factors such as    gender, Age, and Class had a major influence on the survivability of the passengers.
•	Gender: More females survived as compared to males and this could be because the officials tried to rescue the females first before helping the males. Approximately 18.89% of males survived while 74.2% of females survived.

•	Class: People in the 1st and 2nd class survived more as compared to people in 3rd the class this could be influenced by the fact that the 3rd class had more people secondly, we can assume that the officials focused on saving the women and children from the 1st class first, followed by the 2nd class. The survival rate for the 1st class was 62.96% and for the 2nd class was 47.28% while the 3rd class had 24.24%

•	Age: According to the findings a lot of adults survived this is obviously because the ship contained more grown up passengers as compared to children secondly, this can be caused by the fact that the ship had more women who were adults, however the ratio of children who survived is more than that one of adults, approximately 53.98% of children survived and 38.1% of adults survived.
